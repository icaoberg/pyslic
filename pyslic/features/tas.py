     The current implementation is an adapted version which
    is free of parameters. The thresholding is done beforehand
    (automatically), the margin around the mean of pixels to be
    included is the standard deviation of the pixel values
    and not fixed to 30, as before.

     Use tas() to get the original version of the features.
    Also do NOT run the preprocessing code on images on which the original
    are to be calculated on.
