====================================================
PySLIC: Python Subcellular Location Image Classifier
====================================================

This is a re-implementation in Python of the Murphy Lab image classification code.

==========================================
INSTALL
==========================================

python setup.py install

or

python setup.py install --prefix=<SOME_PATH_TO_INSTALL_TO>


==========================================
DEPENDENCIES
==========================================

This needs Python 2.5 to run.

The dependencies are fairly standard libraries:

	+ numpy
	+ scipy
    + ImageMagick++
    + Python Imaging Library

On ubuntu, you can use the following command to install dependencies:

sudo aptitude install python-numpy python-scipy python-imaging libmagick++10

------------------
Soft Dependencies
------------------

Soft dependencies are worked around if not present, but there is a perfomance cost.

    * If a C++ compiler is found and useable, the code will run much faster, but it is not a strict dependency.
    * If ncreduce is installed (http://luispedro.org/software/ncreduce), it will be used by pyslic.classify.
